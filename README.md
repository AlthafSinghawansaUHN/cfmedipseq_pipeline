## Snakemake profiles

For a guide on how to create a Snakemake profile for your cluster setup, see https://www.sichong.site/2020/02/25/snakemake-and-slurm-how-to-manage-workflow-with-resource-constraint-on-hpc/

Create a slurm_log directory when running snakemake to place log files based on the out location of the config.yaml, example config.yaml is provided as snakemake_slurm_config.yaml
